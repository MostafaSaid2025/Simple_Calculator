# Simple_Calculator

This project is a simple calculator designed for the PIC18F4620 microcontroller unit (MCU). It utilizes drivers for GPIO, Keypad, and LCD 4-bit display to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator can handle two numbers, each up to 4 digits in length, and the result is displayed on the LCD display.

Key Features:

Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Input capacity: Two numbers, each up to 4 digits.
Maximum result: 2^32 - 1.
Easily scalable for future enhancements and modifications.
This project serves as a learning resource for those interested in embedded systems development using the PIC18F4620 MCU. The modular design allows for easy expansion and customization, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced developers alike.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute improvements, or use it as a reference for your own projects!
